Remember live journal and webrings and geocities and just writing text and not being worried where 
it's hosted and what framework to use to display it? 

Remember making a website about dolphins (why not tigers 🐅?) or being able to look at 100 (lets make it 5.4M) websites about 
dolphins in a row? This is kind of like that.

BTW, in case you're wondering, this is Khaleel's blog, no matter how many elephants, dolphins, tigers or donuts🍩 you see!
