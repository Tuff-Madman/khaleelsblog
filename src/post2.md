title: Help, code formatting isn't workomh, I mean working!
date: 2020-01-22

The title says it all. Code formatting is not working, at least for me. I've followed everything that the 11ty website said, but it's not working. *Great!* At least I'm not getting any errors. Because getting an error in 11ty causes the whole website not to run! 

I'll tell you something. If you decide to start blogging one day, **never** *ever* use a mobile phone for typing, unless it's an iPhone. Most Android phones use Gboard (when I typed this right now, it came as Gbiatd üòÇ) and they are terrible. I don't know how people type so well with Gboard because for example, when I press the letter 'h', it's the letter 'j' that's getting pressed. The only way I can type correctly now is using swipe typing. And that's the biggest mistake I'm doing right now.

Coding on mobile is also the same. It takes me hours to code something basic, which I could type very fast on a normal desktop computer. First, you gotta hunt for all the symbols like parenthesis and lesser than and greater than symbols, then I have to switch between numbers, symbols and letters in the keyboard and then I gotta put all those symbols again to close the brackets and parenthesises. No, auto closing doesn't work for Glitch on mobile phones.

That's all I'm gonna say right now. I'll type another 300 words when I'm in front of a desktop keyboard or my laptop. (*Many people think this is an excuse to stop blogging, but not in my case.*)

And if anyone can help me with the code formatting, let  me know, if  I've done it incorrectly. Email me at khalby786@gmail.com üòÅ

PS. Let me try once `more`!

```
console.log('Will it work?');
