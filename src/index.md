# Khaleel Gibran

This is just my blog. Yeah, my official blog. I have another blog which is made using Hexo, but I made it because

- I wanted to test the Hexo framework
- I was following @potch's tutorial
- I was testing Glitch's limitations because Hexo is heavy!!!

_NOTICE TO ALL:_ Where ever you see a white, badly pixelated donut (or doughnut?) on a blue and purple background, then that's ME!!!

## Who Am I?

_A good question, first of all._

Just a thirteen-year-old boy who is currently learning how to create Discord bots that can deliver him pizza, building faster websites by React(ing), getting confused between server-side and client-side code, and receiving `Uncaught in promise: DOM Exception` errors.

### Me:

- I am an internet cartoonist.

- I draw a webcomic named [The Picatoon](https://thepicatoon.wordpress.com)

- I build and program robots in my free time (while I'm not at school)
