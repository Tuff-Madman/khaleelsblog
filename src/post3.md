It all began on a...err, I forgot the date. Sorry, folks! Well, I'm a Regular of the Glitch Support Forum and I was happily answering a few queries, because every time I wake up in the morning, I go on a posting streak which kind of satisfies me when I see my profile picture in the first 7 topics. After, that I plug in my laptop and I go to school! üè´ 

I had a good day and a good lunch and when I came back home, my mom was kinda depressed and sad about something that had happend unfortunately. Turns out, there had been voltagr fluctuations with the power supply (this is how Indian power supply is üòÉ) and me and my mom had plugged in my laptop and my mom had plugged in her MacBook. And then there was some hissing noises and the chargers ceased to work. You could say it blew out. Well, I was fortunate that nothing had happend to the laptop and only the charger...but the Lenovo ThinkPad T520 isn't supported by Lenovo anymore so I can't buy a replacement charger from them! And this is why, I have been inactive in both, Glitch Support and Glitch.

I've been using my mom's mobile phone ever since and it is not too bad. But to type this I had to turn off auto-correct and turn on swipe-typing. GitHub and Glitch Support Forums work well, although I have trouble coding on Glitch. But I try my best.

And my eigth-grade annual examinations are round the corner (in fact, it's next door!) and I'm gonna temporarily halt all the coding and support stuff and Discord and yadda yadda. 

So to whoever is reading this, don't expect a posting streak from me for the next month. I'll be back after that!

Goodbye!
