My (coding) TODO for everyone to view. It keeps me organised! üòÇüòÅ

NOTE: You might or might not understand what I've typed below, but I'll leave a note beside each todo for everyone to read!

1. Delete all unnecessary projects from my Glitch profile. (I have a lot of them because I sometimes remix other projects for support on the Glitch Support Forum or to test some bugs. I have many remixes of starter Glitch templates!)

2. Add a proper description for each project or else I wont know what it does, no matter what stupid name it has.

3. Start writing READMEs because until recently I didn't even create one for projects and now when I started writing, it sucks!

4. Rewrite the whole [scrolltotop.js](https://github.com/khalby786/scrolltotop.js). For those who don't know, this is one of my first JavaScript projects and it adds a small 'back to the top' button to the webpage, but it was written completely with differnt functions, even for its customisation. 
In the rewrite, I'm planning to add all the functions into an object with ES6 syntax.

5. Backup/publish this to GitHub. (Not wishing to explain the reason!)

6. Discover more about this `.data`  and `.logs` files problem (getting hidden) because they're getting gitignored. Someone from the Glitch staff care to tell me more about this?

7. Toggle CSS for khaleelgibran.tk according to device dimensions.

8. Create a banner for @chroventor's Endb. Endb is a simple adapter for easily establishing a database of supported types. Read more [here](https://endb.js.org)

Thats all I have for now, more will be coming, I'm sure. All completed todos will automatically disappear. JK! üòÇüòú
