title: How This Blog Came Into Existance

So, it all began after my Hexo blog started to crash and had just missed the disk space limit (for Glitch projects).

Hang on, I wanna see how code formatting looks here:

```
console.log("There's no point in formatter")
```

No, actually it sucks. It just this neon green coloured box that's containing the code and there's no syntax highlighting. I saw a plugin in the 11ty website for code formatting. Maybe I'll add that later.

Yeah, so as I was saying, I liked how Hexo looked. It gave you a lot of themes and additionally, you could edit the main skeleton HTML, so it was very flexible. But  it had numerous files which were part of each theme and then there was my 1050x1050px donut üç© images which caused the whole project to lag, that I couldn't even change the projects description. I tried would writing new posts on my Mom's mobile phone, but the project didn't even load! I was forced to search for an alternative. The thing was that I wanted to create one with pure code and not with blogging softwares such as WordPress. I tried Ghost blogs but they weren't great. Finally, while reading through the Glitch Blog, I found this really simple blog which was ready to be remixed. I wasted no time in remixing it and started to customize it however I liked. I had a lot of trouble writing this post, because my logs are filled with some errors regarding the date format of the post being not UTC and there might be chances that the date would show the time as 00:00 in the midnight. No, don't believe it, it's because in not mentioning the tone along with this. Now all that's left for me is to customize it even more, add the code formatting, add a custom domain and keep writing!

Thanks to @jenn (director of community engineering at Glitch) because I had to refer to jenngineering to see how to implement RSS feeds.
